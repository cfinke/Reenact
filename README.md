Reenact
=======

A camera app for reenacting photos: Young Me, Now Me; daily timelapses; pregnancy belly pictures -- if you need to take two pictures from the same angle, Reenact them.

`/audio/shutter.opus` is from the stock Firefox OS camera app: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/camera/resources/sounds/shutter.opus
